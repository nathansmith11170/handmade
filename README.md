This is a project mostly for learning, and will probably take a very long time
and produce nothing of real worth in the end.

However, the main concept of this is to build a game by hand following some
tutorials related to the Handmade Hero video series along with other materials
from that community. Check it out: https://hero.handmade.network/

# The goals/milestones for the game are:

## The player may join and own a corporation

The game mechanics should include both participating in an NPC corporation and
owning a player corporation

## Economic Model

The concept of the economics in the game will follow corporate, contractual
economics, instead of the kind of buy low sell high representation often seen.
Essentially, instead of buying wares at one factory and then selling them at
another, there is a contract for a transport corporation to move those goods.

## Mercenary Career

The player can choose to join or own a mercenary corporation instead of an
industrial one.

## NPC corporations

The universe should also have existing corporations that are behaving as
corporations ought to behave.

## Combat System

The basics of the combat system is a real-time turn-based rhythm game, where
attacks land on one of 4 beats per turn, and the defense systems need to be
timed appropriately.

## Multiplayer

The ability to host a game for up to a dozen players.
